Step by step method :

    1) You can practise individual modules - VPC , RDS 

    2) Once you are comfortable with individual modules you can launch the complete webapp

App overview :

    Create a VPC

        Create a Public subnet

        Create a Private Subnet

    Create separate security Groups for web servers, application servers, load balancers and RDS

        Create a Application load balancer for web servers

            Create target groups for ALB  and add instances to that group

    Creating a autoscaling group of instances for web servers [linux based either ubuntu or Redhat ]

        Launch the web servers in Public Sunet

    Create a Application load balancer for Application servers

        Create target groups for ALB and add instances to that group

    Creating a autoscaling group of instances for Application servers [Linux based either ubuntu or Redhat]

        Launch the Application servers in Private Subnet

    Create a RDS  with replication feature connected to application servers

For Demo purposes  we will :

use nginx on Web Servers

Use Apache on Application Servers
